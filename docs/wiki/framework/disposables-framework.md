Support for the ace disposable framework will be dropped in 3.13!
Switch to the [CBA Disposable Framework](https://github.com/CBATeam/CBA_A3/wiki/Disposable-Launchers)

Old weapon configs that are no longer supported:
```cpp
    ACE_UsedTube = "launch_banana_Used_F";
    ACE_isUsedLauncher = 1;
```
