## 1. Overview

"Default action" icon shows up automatically in Arma 3 when something in front of the cursor is interactable, disturbing the player. This component prevents that icon from ever showing.

It does **NOT** remove the availability or activation of that action. It is advisable to also unbind "Use default action" key to prevent unwanted interactions.

## 3. Dependencies
